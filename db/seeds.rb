# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).

# Examples:

#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# An STI approach was used to seperate the experience between fan and brewry owner. AJAX is behind project categories and user comments. Sass is used for certain affects but mostly does in css with some Foundation help. We used Stripe for payments.',

# 							 description: 'For funtionality we allowed a user to save their article before posting, comment on articles and discover articles through tags. Probably the most interesting feature is the ability to vote for each article out of 100. We then ranked articles according to their average vote. If an article has an average score under 40 we destory the article after 10 votes. This is a strategy to regulate poor content.',
